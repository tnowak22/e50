The testing branch will serve as the main production branch. The master branch will preserve the original scripts that were used as a proof of concept.

# Tracking Changes

Changes made:

*   edited the master file; added functions to clean up the script

*   added a script to turn the motor clockwise (in one direction)

*   added a script to turn the motor counter clockwise&#x20;

*   created a script that will count the number of steps. this can be used to determine the number of steps for a complete rotation around the track. this will be used to compute the number of steps between txmit and receive antenna locations.

Changes to be made:

*   ~~add a script to turn the motor counter clockwise (in the other direction)~~

*   ~~alter the master script to be able to select the direction of rotation~~

*   determine how to convert number of positions to steps or vice versa
