# Wiki

This wiki contains the documentation for setting up the software side of the project. I have divided the wiki into several pages for clarity. Not all of the wiki pages may be necessary. For future groups who continue working on the project, we aim to have the Raspberry Pi and supporting harware all set up. If this is the case, then for data collection, the following steps should be taken:

1.  Familiarize yourselves with [how the system works](/wiki/system_overview.md)

2.  Install the Shockline Software on the PC you want to collect data (link to software)

3.  Clone the github repository onto that same PC

4.  Set up the python environment on the PC ([see here](/wiki/python_pc.md))

5.  Run the python script according to the usage page ([see here](/script/README.md))
