# E50 - Scattered Field Measurement System

Fall '21 - Spring '22 Senior Design Group; Scattered Field Measurement System

The following repository documents work done for a senior design project at Marquette University. The group was tasked with creating an apparatus that would collect scattered field information from a known object. This repository documents the hardware and software that was used and any initial setup that was required.&#x20;

***

The repository will be divided in several sections. The first will outline the steps required to initialize the Raspberry Pi that is used to control a motor. The second will take a look at the API of the vector network analyzer (VNA) that was used to transmit and receive signals. The third will consist of the python scripts that allow us to interface between the PC, VNA, Raspberry Pi, and motor to collect and store relevant data.&#x20;
